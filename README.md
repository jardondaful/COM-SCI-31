# COM-SCI-31
These are my solutions to projects and homework assignments assigned in UCLA's COM SCI-31 class in Fall 2021. The README.md for each folder contains each of the project's specifications. Please do not try to copy or re-use any of my code for future classes. The purpose of this repository is to back up my work and to serve as a resource for self-education
